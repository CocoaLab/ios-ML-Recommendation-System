ios-ML-Recommendation-System
=================

Implemented an optimized Machine Learning (マシンラーニング) in this project to achieve the recommendation system the learning mechanism (おすすめの商品). It demos how to simplely analyze user behavior to calculate projects selling-rate (the sellers could see how much possible rate of the products could be sold), and to calculate of buyers how much love their seeing products, then, the system could learn from feedback of user behavior, then, the system could recommend best fitting product for buyer to up the choosing. 

## How to use

Just see the source code and build it up. Asking me, if you need a help.

## Version

V1.0

## License

MIT.

### BTW

This project still need to tune the mechanism and performance, it just a demo of used machine learning in user behavior analyzing. I'll keep in enhancing this project to prove the machine learning could be perfectly working on mobile businesses.
